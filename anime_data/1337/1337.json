While Kaede doesn't dislike games, what she really, truly dislikes is being in pain. She creates a character named Maple, and decides to put all her points in VIT to minimize pain. As a result, she moves slowly, can't use magic, and even a rabbit can get the best of her. But as it turns out, she acquires a skill known as \"Absolute Defense\" as a result of her pumping points into VIT, as well as a \"Counter Skill\" that works against special moves. Now, with her ability to nullify all damage, she goes on adventures.
