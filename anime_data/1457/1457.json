Technology based on this power allows them to perform a great multitude of tasks such as shoot projectiles and pilot mobile suits (called Golems in this society). Rygart Arrow is an un-sorcerer, a rare individual who is unable to levitate even the smallest crystal. Living with his brother at a farm, he receives a letter from an old friend, Hodr, the current king. Close companion of the king and queen when they were students at Assam Military School, Arrow is informed that a war is about to occur. Hodr called him because an ancient type of Golem has been found in a mining shaft. No one has been able to move it and Queen Sigyn, an expert engineer, suspects that maybe an un-sorcerer might be the key to activate it.", "episode": "50 minutes", "vintage": ["2010-05-29"], "official_website": "http://www.production-ig.co.jp/contents/works_sp/1930_/index.html", "opening_theme": ["\"Fate\" by Kokia"], "ending_theme": ["\"SERIOUS-AGE\" by Faylan", "\"Nageki no Oto (\u5606\u304d\u306e\u97f3)\" by Kokia (ep 6)"], "insert_song": ["\"Omoi (\u30f2\u30e2\u30a4)\" by Kokia (ep 4)"], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A10952-310499783.1404846887.jpg", "file_category": "b"}
