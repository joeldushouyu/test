The loss of her magic crystals means that she is not officially a witch anymore. To handle this enormous problem, the Witch Queen asks Doremi, Hazuki, Aiko, Onpu, and Momoko to take care of the new older-looking Hana-chan in their world for the moment. In the meantime, the little former sorceress will have to complete the witch apprentice exams in order to attain a magic crystal and hopefully become a witch once again.", "episode": "51", "vintage": ["2002-02-03 to 2003-01-26", "2004-03-21 (France)"], "official_website": "http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/tv/doremi_D/", "opening_theme": ["\"DANCE!
