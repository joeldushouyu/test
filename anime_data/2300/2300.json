Another spatial quake warning sends him out to a ruined amusement park to meet the newest Spirit, the green-haired Natsume, who dresses like a witch and uses magical powers to render AST attackers comically ineffective. Although things go well at first, he inadvertently offends her, and her retribution comes by pretending to be him and trying to ruin his reputation at school. When that effort ultimately gets thwarted by Origami and Tohka, she resorts to a much more involved plan that could result in one of the people around him disappearing.", "episode": "12", "vintage": ["2019-01-11", "2019-01-11 to 2019-03-29 (Animax Asia)"], "official_website": "http://date-a-live-anime.com/", "opening_theme": ["\"I swear\" by sweet ARMS"], "ending_theme": ["\"Last Promise\" by Yamazaki Erii"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A21509-1687186927.1545101878.jpg", "file_category": "d"}
