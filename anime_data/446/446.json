Amuri Kakyoin is one of these \"Adapters\" with a very unhelpful trait: her body physically repulses anything that approaches her. Lonely and solemn, Amuri has drifted through life in solitude; but one day, when the spaceship she is traveling on is destroyed, Amuri's luck finally changes; bouncing back and forth between space debris, she finally bounces into Uterus, a medical recovery capsule, where she is joined by a quiet girl and her robotic bunny. Alongside her new Adapter companions, Amuri will help defend the enemy in the skies with her new ability-amplifying suit.In the year 01 of the new age, the sun began to radiate increased amounts of radiation. A few years later, very strong children with unique abilities were born. Amuri Kakyoin is a 13 year old girl born with a special 'Allergy', called 'Repultion'. This ability keeps her from actually touching most of her environment, but also protects her from harm. During a trip to space station Pink Coral, unknown enemies from the junk planet Galapagos attack and destroy the entire space station. Amuri survives being launched into space because of her 'Allergy', but is picked up by the attackers. When the machines of Galapagos attempt to destroy her, a girl named Suzu Ling Yunque shows up with a kimono-like space suit designed from Amuri's DNA. The suit lets her use her 'Repulsion' ability on a large scale. Amuri has lived her whole life unable to touch other people, however, this cheerful and strange girl was not Repulsed upon contact.", "episode": "3", "vintage": ["2008-03-31 (first episode special broadcast)"], "official_website": "http://www.amuri.jp/", "opening_theme": [], "ending_theme": ["\"Ya-chaouyo\" by Dance*Man"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A8720-14.jpg", "file_category": "a"}
