He prefers his behind-the-scenes work with the avant-garde theater troupe Bondage Horse to his studies (probably because he has a crush on the troupe\u2019s leader, Miss Shimomura). The thing is, his great-grandfather has just died and left him an inheritance of 450 million yen... on the condition that he graduate from college and start a career. Then there\u2019s Aya, the very sexy woman he finds in his bed the morning after the funeral and who proceeds to force her way into Suekichi\u2019s life. He\u2019s pretty sure she\u2019s only after his inheritance, but her frequent seductions are impossible for him to resist. Add a theater-loving yakuza, the great-grandfather\u2019s lawyer, Aya\u2019s ex-husband and the pretty young Miyuki to the mix, and Suekichi\u2019s life seems destined to spin out of control.
