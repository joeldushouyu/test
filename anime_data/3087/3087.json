The catch is a hole in one corner of the living room, which turns out to open into the realm of the gods. That leads to various divine spirits eventually showing up and taking residence in his place. Most of them are Eto-Shin, divine spirits which take the animal girl forms of the animals from the Chinese zodiac. The first and most troublesome of the lot, the Cat spirit Nya-tan, is an Eto-Musume, a lower-ranked spirit who can compete for the right to raise herself to Eto-Shin status. And that is exactly what Nya-tan aims to do. Too bad she has amnesia and the Rat Eto-Shin, Chu-tan, is out to get her.", "episode": "12", "vintage": ["2015-04-09"], "official_website": "http://etotama.com/", "opening_theme": ["\"Retry Rendezvous\" (\u30ea\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u2606\u30e9\u30f3\u30c7\u30f4\u30fc) by Rie Murakawa"], "ending_theme": ["\"blue moment\" by Sol/Lull BOB"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A16520-1702575188.1426543529.jpg", "file_category": "e"}
