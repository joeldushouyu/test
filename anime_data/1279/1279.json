Because of his ability, he is able to meet a female death god (AKA Shinigami) named Rukia Kuchiki. To save his family and friends from unwanted soul-eating spirits (Hollows), Rukia transfers her Shinigami powers to Ichigo. As Rukia takes on a human shell, together they solve mysteries involving spirits and Hollows until from the spirit world come two other Shinigami, who explain that it is illegal to transfer Shinigami powers to humans and that Rukia exceeded the time limit to stay in the human world. After they sentence her death for breaking the law, Ichigo snaps and swears to everyone he will retrieve Rukia by breaking into the spirit world.", "episode": "366", "vintage": ["2004-10-05 to 2012-03-27 (Japan - TV Tokyo)", "2006-09-08 to 2009-10-11 (Canada, YTV - Bionix [Episodes 1-109])", "2006-09-09 (USA, Cartoon Network - Adult Swim)", "2007-01-07 (Malaysia, TV3)", "2007-04-16 (Philippines, Gma Network[5pm])", "2007-07-12 (Spain, Canal Buzz)", "2007-09-01 (France, MCM)", "2007-09-12 (Poland, Hyper)", "2007-09-23", "2007-10-22 (Spain, Cuatro\u00ba)", "2008-01-26 (Animax Hungary)", "2008-01-26 (Animax Romania)", "2008-05-06 to 2009-04-28 (Animax Brazil [Episodes 1-52])", "2008-05-06 to 2009-04-28 (Animax Latin America - Eps 1 to 52)", "2009-06-23 (starhub E-city)", "2009-07-18 (Animax Germany)", "2009-12-18 (Animax Asia)", "2010-03-05 (Portugal, SIC K)", "2010-12-21 (Russia, 2x2)", "2011-05-16 (Portugal, SIC Radical)", "2011-07-01 (Brazil, Sony Spin [Episodes 53-109])", "2011-07-01 to 2011-08-26 (Latin America, Sony Spin [Episodes 53-109])", "2013-05-13 (ETC...TV - Chile)", "2013-07-15 (Nicaragua, TN8)", "2014-04-10 to 2014-10-01 (Brazil, PlayTV [Episodes 1-52])", "2014-08-12 to 2014-10-29 (Chile, ETC...TV [Episodes 53-109])", "2015-04-08 to 2015-10-21 (Brazil, PlayTV [Episodes 53-109])", "2015-11-02 to 2016-01-12 (Chile, ETC...TV [Episodes 110-167])", "2016-04-04 to 2016-10-19 (Brazil, PlayTV [Episodes 110-167])", "2016-05-02 to 2016-07-26 (Chile, ETC...TV [Episodes 168-229])"], "official_website": "http://animaxtv.co.za/shows/bleach", "opening_theme": ["\"*~Asterisk\" by Orange Range (eps 1-25)", "\"D-tecnolife\" by UVERworld (eps 26-51)", "\"Ichirin no Hana\" by High and Mighty Color (eps 52-74)", "\"Tonight, Tonight, Tonight\" by Beat Crusaders (eps 75-97)", "\"Rolling star\" by YUI (eps 98-120)", "\"ALONES\" by Aqua Timez (eps 121-143)", "\"After Dark\" by Asian Kung-Fu Generation (eps 144-167)", "\"CHU-BURA\" by Kelun (eps 168-189)", "\"Velonica\" by Aqua Timez (eps 190-)", "\"Sh\u014djo S\" by SCANDAL (eps 215-242)", "\"Anima Rossa\" (\u30a2\u30cb\u30de\u30ed\u30c3\u30b5) by Porno Graffitti (eps 243-265)", "\"chAngE\" by miwa (eps 266-291)", "\"Ranbu no Melody\" (\u4e71\u821e\u306e\u30e1\u30ed\u30c7\u30a3; \"Melody of the Wild Dance\") by SID (eps 292-316)", "\"BLUE\" by ViViD (eps 317-342)", "\"HARUKAZE\" by SCANDAL (eps 343-)"], "ending_theme": ["\"Life is Like a Boat\" by Rie Fu (eps 1-13)", "\"Thank You!!\" by HOME MADE KAZOKU (eps 14-25)", "\"Houkiboshi\" (\u307b\u3046\u304d\u661f; \"Comet\") by Younha (eps 26-38)", "\"happypeople\" by Skoop on Somebody (eps 39-51)", "\"Life\" by YUI (eps 52-63)", "\"My Pace\" by SunSet Swish (eps 64-74)", "\"Hanabi\" by Ikimono-gakari (eps 75-86)", "\"MOVIN!!\" by Takacha (eps 87-97)", "\"Baby It's You\" by JUNE (eps 98-109)", "\"Sakura Biyori\" by Mai Hoshimura (eps 110-120)", "\"Tsumasaki\" (\u722a\u5148; \"Tiptoe\") by Ore Ska Band (eps 121-131)", "\"Daidai\" (\u6a59; \"Bitter Orange\") by chatmonchy (eps 132-143)", "\"Tane o Maku Hibi\" (\u7a2e\u3092\u307e\u304f\u65e5\u3005) by Atari Kousuke (eps 144-154)", "\"Kansha.\" (\u611f\u8b1d\u3002; \"Gratitude.\") by RSP a.k.a Real Street Project (eps 155-167)", "\"Orange\" (\u30aa\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8) by Lil'B a.k.a MIE&AILA (eps 168-179)", "\"Gallop\" (\u30ae\u30e3\u30ed\u30c3\u30d7) by pe'zmoku (eps 180-189)", "\"Hitohira no Hanabira\" (\u30d2\u30c8\u30d2\u30e9\u306e\u30cf\u30ca\u30d3\u30e9) by Stereopony (eps 190-201)", "\"Sky Chord ~Otona ni Naru Kimi e~\" by Tsuji Shion (eps 202-214)", "\"Kimi o Mamotte, Kimi o Aishite\" by Sambomaster (eps 215-229)", "\"Mad Surfer\" by Kenichi Asai (eps 230-242)", "\"Sakurabito\" (\u3055\u304f\u3089\u3073\u3068) by SunSet Swish (eps 243-255)", "\"Tabidatsu Kimi e\" (\u65c5\u7acb\u3064\u30ad\u30df\u3078; \"On a Journey to You\") by RSP (eps 256-265)", "\"Stay Beautiful\" by DIGGY-MO' (eps 266-278)", "\"Echoes\" by universe (eps 279-291)", "\"Last Moment\" by SPYAIR (eps 292-303)", "\"Song for...\" by ROOKiEZ is PUNK\u2019D (eps 304-316)", "\"Aoi Tori\" (\u30a2\u30aa\u30a4\u30c8\u30ea; \"Blue Bird\") by fumika (eps 317-329)", "\"Haruka Kanata\" by UNLIMITS (eps 330-342)", "\"Re:pray\" by Aimer (eps 343-354)", "\"MASK\" by Aqua Timez (eps 355-)"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/crop900x350/video/category/15/key_art_bleach.jpg", "file_category": "b"}
