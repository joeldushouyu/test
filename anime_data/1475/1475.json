In the real world there may be nothing special about him, but online he's one of the world's top players of the combat game called Btooom. One day he awakens on what appears to be a tropical island, though he has no memory of how he got there or why. While exploring the island Ryota runs into a stranger who attacks him by throwing a strange looking bomb at him. Ryota then realizes that his life is in danger, and that he has somehow become trapped in a real-life version of his favorite game. Ryota and the other \"players\" must now survive through the nightmare to figure out the reason why they ended up in the game in the first place.", "episode": "12", "vintage": ["2012-10-04 to 2012-12-20"], "official_website": "http://mvm-films.com/AnimeTitle?ID=3117", "opening_theme": ["\"No Pain, No Game\" by Nano", "\"Exist (\u30a8\u30b0\u30b8\u30b9\u30c8)\" by Nano (ep 12)"], "ending_theme": ["\"Aozora (Blue Skies)\" by May'n", "\"No Pain, No Game\" by Nano (ep 12)"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A14418-2247715122.1348138432.jpg", "file_category": "b"}
