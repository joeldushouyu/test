Keroberos, the Guardian of the Clow Cards, informs Sakura that it is now her responsibility to find and capture the freed cards. However, much to the reluctant Sakura's dismay, things aren't going to be easy for her; simply saying magic words and waving her wand around isn't good enough. Each card is a living, thinking, extremely powerful being. She'll have to learn to cope with her new responsibilities, as well as ordinary troubles involving love, school, family, and friends. With the support of her friend Tomoyo and a young boy with powers of his own, she must learn how to use her newly awakened magical abilities to collect each card and prevent the disaster that will befall the world if she doesn't.", "episode": "70", "vintage": ["1998-04-07 to 2000-03-21", "1998-11 to 2005-02 (Italy)", "1999-09-04 (France)", "2000 (Cartoon Network Latin America)", "2000-09 (France Air Date)", "2000-09-18 to 2000-12-25 (C33 - Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya)", "2000-11-01 (Cartoon Network Latin America)", "2001 (Colombia - Canal Caracol)", "2001-07-23 (Philippines)", "2001-09 (Portugal, RTP1)", "2001-09-03 (ETC...TV - Chile)", "2001-09-24 (Chilevision - Chile)", "2003 (Canal Panda - Portugal)", "2006-04-03 (Boomerang Latin America)", "2008-08-18 to 2008-11-21 (Philippines, Funbox on Q)", "2008-09 (Latin America - Boomerang - 2nd Time)", "2020-12-08 (Brazil - Mega Crush on Loading)"], "official_website": "https://web.archive.org/web/20030601122819/http://www.madman.com.au/cardcaptors", "opening_theme": ["\"Ba Bian Xiao Ying\" (\u767e\u8b8a\u5c0f\u6afb; Variety Sakura) by Zeng Carrie [Cantonese version]", "\"Cardcaptors Main Title\" by Dave Dore [U.S. version]", "\"Dan Lian Wuyu\" (\u55ae\u6200\u7269\u8a9e; Love Story) by Karena Lam [Taiwanese version]", "\"No Nagging\" by Froggy Mix [Canadian French version]", "\"Catch You Catch Me\" by Gumi (eps 1-35)", "\"Pesca la tua carta Sakura\" by Cristina D'Avena (eps 1-35)", "\"Sakura, la partita non \u00e8 finita\" by Cristina D'Avena (eps 36-70)", "\"Tobira o Akete\" by ANZA (eps 36-46)", "\"Platinum\" by Maaya Sakamoto (eps 47-70)"], "ending_theme": ["\"Groovy!\" by Koumi Hirose (eps 1-35)", "\"Honey\" by Chihiro (eps 36-46)", "\"Fruits Candy\" by Megumi Kojima (eps 47-69)", "\"Platinum\" by Maaya Sakamoto (ep 70)"], "insert_song": ["\"Hitorijime\" (\u30d2\u30c8\u30ea\u30b8\u30e1) by Gumi (ep 34)", "\"Ki ni Naru Aitsu\" (\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u308b\u30a2\u30a4\u30c4) by Motoko Kumai (ep 57)", "\"Mienai Chizu\" (\u898b\u3048\u306a\u3044\u5730\u56f3) by ANZA (ep 68)", "\"Prism\" (\u30d7\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0) by Sakura Tange (ep 38)", "\"Shiawase no Mah\u014d\" (\u3057\u3042\u308f\u305b\u306e\u9b54\u6cd5) by Sakura Tange (ep 37)", "\"Tomo e\" (\u53cb\u3078) by Junko Iwao (ep 37)", "\"Yasashisa no Tane\" (\u3084\u3055\u3057\u3055\u306e\u7a2e\u5b50) by Junko Iwao (ep 37)", "\"Yoru no Uta\" (\u591c\u306e\u6b4c) by Junko Iwao (ep 5)"], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A126-1691590026.1442278236.jpg", "file_category": "c"}
