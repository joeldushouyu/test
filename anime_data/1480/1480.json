The fact that he used to be the charismatic leader of a legendary biker gang has turned into an urban legend. However, after starting a rivalry with the captain of the school baseball team, he and two former members, become their star players. But it's not long before his past catches up to him... (The last episode rewinds to Jin's pre-bousouzoku days and the origin of his gang.)", "episode": 0, "vintage": ["1989 to 1991"], "official_website": [[]], "opening_theme": [], "ending_theme": [], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A7141-6.jpg", "file_category": "b"}
