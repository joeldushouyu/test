He volunteered to guide her way to the address she was looking for, which looked like in his neighborhood but turned out to be an empty lot. Not knowing what to do next, Kaoru invited the devastated girl to his apartment and asked for additional clue -- a photo with two children whom Kaoru immediately identified as himself and Aoi Sakuraba, his childhood friend. It turned out that the girl in front of him is Aoi Sakuraba herself, his betrothed fianc\u00e9e who came all the way to Tokyo to marry him. Her revelation was not only surprising but also reminded the deepest part of Kaoru's memory for why he left the Hanabishi family in the first place.", "episode": "24", "vintage": ["2002-04-10 to 2002-09-26", "2005-12-29 (K3 - Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya)", "2006-07-01 to 2006-12-09 (Singapore, Channel U)"], "official_website": "http://www.aiyoriaoshi.com", "opening_theme": ["\"Towa no Hana (Eternal Flower)\" by Yoko Ishida"], "ending_theme": ["\"Akai Hana\" by The Indigo (ep 15)", "\"I'll Be Home\" by Satsuki Yukino (ep 18)", "\"Namo Shirenu Hana\" by The Indigo", "\"Towa no Hana (Eternal Flower)\" by Yoko Ishida (ep 24)"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/crop900x350/video/category/874/10224.jpeg", "file_category": "b"}
