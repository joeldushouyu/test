Montgomery, the little red-haired orphan comes to life in this anime, based on the first book in the long Anne series. Nobody has ever wanted her in her long and lonely 11-year-old life... until this dream comes true and she is going to have a wonderful home in Green Gables on Prince Edward Island with Marilla and Mathew Cuthbert. But all turns too good to be true - it was just a mistake; the Cuthberts have \"ordered a boy\" from the orphanage and have no need for a girl. And yet, soon Marilla and Matthew discover that they cannot live without this lively imaginative chatterbox. Green Gables becomes her home; Diana - the best \"bosom friend\" any girl ever dreamed of; Gilbert - the hated but never-despairing boy in love... Friends, dreams and school, scrapes and funny accidents, laughter and tears, tragedies and achievements - fill Anne's life as she goes on her road of growing up.", "episode": "50", "vintage": ["1979-01-07 to 1979-12-30", "1988-10-06 (Germany)", "1998-06-29 (Philippines - aired on ABS-CBN)", "2003-07-09 (Philippines - aired on GMA)"], "official_website": "http://www.b-ch.com/ttl/index.php?ttl_c=1391", "opening_theme": ["\"Kikoeru kashira\" by Ritsuko Ohwada"], "ending_theme": ["\"Samenai Yume\" by Ritsuko Ohwada"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A421-1787325391.1464964953.jpg", "file_category": "a"}
