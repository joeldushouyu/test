He soon comes upon a whole forest full of \"useless animals\"-- that is, animals that don't live up to their species' usual character. After a short fight with the smoking, bad-tempered rabbit, Usahara, Uruno decides that he wants to move on... but changes his mind upon meeting Chiiko, a clumsy cheetah girl. It's love at first sight for Uruno, and after deciding to stay for her, he continues to hope that even though he's a good-for-nothing, he'll win her over someday. That is, if living with the other strange residents of the forest-- including the aformentioned smoking rabbit, a sake-drinking unicorn, a near-sighted owl, a travelling saleswoman bear, and a shy pegasus --doesn't get to him first.", "episode": "26", "vintage": ["2005-01-17"], "official_website": "http://www.takeshobo.co.jp/damekko/top.html", "opening_theme": ["\"Sekai de Ichiban Boku ga Suki!\" by Ryoko Shintani"], "ending_theme": ["\"Life is Free\" by Ryoko Shintani"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A4994-6.jpg", "file_category": "d"}
