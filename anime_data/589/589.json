Just as the balance of power and military might had once shifted from swords to sorcery, it shifts once again to guns. Takeru Kusanagi goes to \"AntiMagic Academy,\" a training facility for Inquisitors of Heretics who crack down on the dwindling threat posed by magic users. However, Takeru cannot use guns at all and can only fight with a sword. As a result, he is relegated to the 35th Test Platoon, the motley \"small fry platoon\" for poor students. One day, \u014cka \u014ctori, the ultra-elite pistol master who already has her qualifications for witch-hunts, joins the platoon.", "episode": "12", "vintage": ["2015-10-07", "2017-10-23 to 2017-11-07 (Philippines, Hero TV)"], "official_website": "http://www.35shoutai.jp/", "opening_theme": ["\"Embrace Blade\" by Afilia Saga"], "ending_theme": ["\"Calling my Twilight\" by Kanako Itou"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A17157-3503880714.1437064890.jpg", "file_category": "a"}
