Makoto and Fujisawa land squarely in the Kingdom of Roshtaria, and quickly befriend the princess Rune Venus. Jinnai allies himself with the Bugrom, a race of giant insects bent on taking over El Hazard, while his sister tries to eke out her own living in the desert. Makoto searches desperately for a way to return home, all the while fighting off the Bugrom, enlisting the help of the Holy Priestesses, and stopping the demon god Ifurita from destroying everything.", "episode": "26", "vintage": ["1995-10-06 to 1996-03-29", "2000 (RTP2, Portugal)", "2001-05-21 (Philippines)"], "official_website": "http://www.aicanime.com/products/elhazard/index.html", "opening_theme": ["\"Illusion\" by Invoice (eps 1-16)", "\"Atsui Kimochi (\u3042\u3064\u3044\u6c17\u6301\u3061)\" by Onestep Communicate (eps 17-26)"], "ending_theme": ["\"Bukiyou Janakya Koi wa Dekinai (\u4e0d\u5668\u7528\u3058\u3083\u306a\u304d\u3083\u604b\u306f\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044)\" by Etsuko Kozakura, Kikuko Inoue, and Rio Natsuki (eps 01-25)", "\"Illusion\" by Invoice (ep 26)"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A263-82.1359653595.jpg", "file_category": "e"}
