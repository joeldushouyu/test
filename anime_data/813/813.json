Asura's life took a turn when he became acquainted with Wakasa, a young village girl who taught Asura words and drew out semblances of empathy from within him. Yet Asura's peaceful moments with Wakasa would not last long, as famine began to take its toll on Wakasa's village.", "episode": 0, "vintage": ["2012-09-29"], "official_website": "http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/movie/2012_asura_movie/", "opening_theme": [], "ending_theme": ["\"Kib\u014d\" (\u5e0c\u671b; Hope) by Yasuha Kominami", "\"Trash\" by Yasuha Kominami"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A13987-3275024354.1348565730.jpg", "file_category": "a"}
