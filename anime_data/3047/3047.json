Ever since beginning their war against the nefarious forces of the so-called Evangelist, Company 8 has unearthed world-shaking secrets that make Shinra's mission even more critical. There are double-agents everywhere in the Fire Force, for one, and Shinra has also learned that his brother and mother, who he thought long dead in an Infernal's blaze, are also agents of the Evangelist. With the fight more personal than ever, Shinra has vowed to not only end spontaneous combustion once and for all, but to find a way save Infernals, including his mother, from their monstrous fates.", "episode": "24", "vintage": ["2020-07-03"], "official_website": "https://fireforce-anime.jp/#index", "opening_theme": ["\"SPARK-AGAIN\" by Aimer", "\"Torch of Liberty\" by KANA-BOON"], "ending_theme": ["\"ID\" by Cidergirl", "\"Desire\" by PELICAN FANCLUB"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A22952-2289826867.1590119837.jpg", "file_category": "e"}
