Two years ago, the island's cherry trees lost this ability and all became ordinary cherry trees that bloom only in the spring. Jun'ichi Asakura is now a graduating senior at Kazami Academy, and is surrounded by many close friends, old and new alike. On a stormy summer day, a mysterious young girl, Aisia, arrives at Jun'ichi's door. She is looking for Sakura's grandmother to study magic, ultimately hoping to bring happiness to everyone. When she discovers that grandmother Yoshino had long since passed away, she joyfully assumes (thanks to his error in judgment) that Jun'ichi is able to teach her. Even though she finally understands that the only magic he's capable of is conjuring Japanese confections, Aisia continues her search for magic on Hatsune-Jima. Amid the chaos of her search, Kazami Academy hires new medical staff.", "episode": "26", "vintage": ["2005-07-02 to 2005-12-24"], "official_website": "http://www.hatsunejima.com/", "opening_theme": ["\"Sakurairo no Kisetsu (The Season of Cherry Blossoms)\" by yozuca*"], "ending_theme": ["\"Akatsuki ni Saku Uta (The Song Blooming Towards Dawn)\" by CooRie (eps 1-23,26)", "\"Kioku Raburetaa (Remembrance Love Letter)\" by CooRie (eps 24-25)"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A4711-27.jpg", "file_category": "d"}
