Ayumu used to live in Tana before, and now his memories of the time are shrouded in mystery - apparently something happened when he was a child. Enter Miku, a young girl who knows more than she tells, weird glowing lights floating around, reflections of UFOish objects in the eyes of cats and dogs, a nosy female announcer, a forest with a mysterious past, and a weird boy called Wakkun, who wears the clothes Ayumu used to when he was a child, and you get the world of Zettai Shonen, where mysteries remain mysteries amidst a slow, normal, everyday life.", "episode": "26", "vintage": ["2005-05-21 to 2005-11-19", "2006-05-01 (Animax Philippines)", "2008-01-21 to 2008-02-22 (Philippines, QTV Channel 11's Funbox)"], "official_website": "http://www3.nhk.or.jp/anime/zettai/index.html", "opening_theme": ["\"Hikari no Silhouette\" by CooRie"], "ending_theme": ["\"Shonen Humming\" by Masumi Ito"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A5093-48.jpg", "file_category": "a"}
