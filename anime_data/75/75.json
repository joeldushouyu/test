Moderated by hard-headed veteran ace Mitsuru Konishi, the \"Airbats\" are an all-female aerial acrobatic team consisting of loose cannons Miyuki Haneda and Arisa Mitaka, karaoke freak and gambling genius Sakura Saginomiya, and junk food lover Yoko Shimorenjaku. Both Haneda and Mitaka do not get along with each other, and their rivalry worsens when they both fall for Isurugi. But with the entire JASDF having doubts about the team, the Airbats must work as a team or face total disbandment.", "episode": "7", "vintage": ["1994-10-21"], "official_website": "http://www.b-ch.com/ttl/index.php?ttl_c=532", "opening_theme": ["\"Niji ni Naritai\" (\u8679\u306b\u306a\u308a\u305f\u3044; \"I Wanna Be a Rainbow\") by Mayaka"], "ending_theme": ["\"Taiy\u014d ga Atatameta Kimochi\" (\u592a\u967d\u304c\u3042\u305f\u305f\u3081\u305f\u6c17\u6301\u3061; \"The Sun Warms My Heart\") by Aya Hisakawa and Ai Orikasa (eps 1-3)", "\"Fuch\u016b Shigure\" (\u5e9c\u4e2d\u3057\u3050\u308c; \"A Light Rain in Fuch\u016b\") by Kikuko Inoue (ep 4)", "\"Aozora no Love Letter\" (\u9752\u7a7a\u306e\u30e9\u30d6\u30ec\u30bf\u30fc; \"Love Letter in the Blue Sky\") by Yukana Nogami (eps 5-7)"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A369-42.jpg", "file_category": "a"}
