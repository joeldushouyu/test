Chrono Shindou is your average middle schooler. His looks make people afraid of him, but he has a kind heart and is loved by children. One day Chrono opens his locker and finds a Cardfight deck no one has ever heard of: Gear Chronicle. Chrono takes it to the nearby Card Capital 2 where he meets one Kamui Katsuragi.
