Their code name is \"Lovely Angels\", but they're better known\u2014universe-wide, in fact\u2014as the \"Dirty Pair\". Their arrival at the scene of a mystery is always a source of hope and dread, since: 1) they always solve the case, 2) wherever they go, something gets horribly wrecked, up to and including entire planets. Lucky for them\u2014but not-so-lucky for the rest of the universe\u2014there are always some sort of extenuating circumstances that support their most often-used phrase, \"It's not our fault\".", "episode": "24", "vintage": ["1985-07-15 to 1985-12-26", "1989-01-08 (France)"], "official_website": "http://dirty-pair.rightstuf.com/", "opening_theme": ["\"Dan et Danny\" by Marie Mercier and Sandrine Bonnet (French dub: eps 1-26)", "\"Ru-Ru-Ru-Russian Roulette\" (\u30ed\u30fb\u30ed\u30fb\u30ed\u30fb\u30ed\u30b7\u30a2\u30f3\u30eb\u30fc\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8) by Meiko Nakahara"], "ending_theme": ["\"Uch\u016b Ren'ai (Space Fantasy)\" (\u5b87\u5b99\u604b\u611b[\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30bf\u30b8\u30fc]) by Meiko Nakahara"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A57-67.jpg", "file_category": "d"}
