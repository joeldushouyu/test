It is said to be 20 to 30 years ahead of the rest of the world. Eighty percent of its 2.3 million residents are students. The focus of studies here is directed towards esper powers. Misaka Mikoto, one of the top level espers in town, shares a room with Kuroko Shirai, another high level esper who is a member of Judgement, a law enforcing agency composed of students. Both attend to Tokiwadai, a private school reserved for the high-leveled and the rich. Kuroko's partner at Judgement, Kazari Uiharu, is a low level esper who studies at Sakugawa middle school. Her best friend and classmate there is Ruiko Saten, a level zero (no esper powers). Together the four encounter several adventures in the exciting scientific town.", "episode": "24", "vintage": ["2009-10-02 to 2010-03-19"], "official_website": "https://toaru-project.com/railgun/", "opening_theme": ["\"only my railgun\" by fripSide (eps 2-14)", "\"LEVEL5-judgelight-\" by fripSide (eps 15-23)"], "ending_theme": ["\"only my railgun\" by fripSide (ep 1)", "\"Dear My Friend\u2014Mada Minu Mirai e\" (Dear My Friend \uff0d\u307e\u3060\u898b\u306c\u672a\u6765\u3078\uff0d) by ELISA (eps 2-11, 13-14, 24)", "\"Smile -You & Me-\" by ELISA (ep 12)", "\"Real Force\" by ELISA (eps 15-23)"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A10706-12.jpg", "file_category": "c"}
