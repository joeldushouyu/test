Maia Mizuki has been trying hard to achieve her dream of joining the Ocean Agency, a government organization. When she fails to be accepted and faces homelessness and hopelessness, a series of unfortunate happenings force her into a job with Neres, a security and investigation company that will also do almost anything else for enough money. It soon becomes obvious that no one \u201cnormal\u201d works at Neres. Shizuka is a kind, tech-crazy young woman with a passion for food, Glora is a trigger-happy, money-loving tomboy, Yuu, a quiet, brooding woman is frighteningly deadly in combat, and Rena is the capable, alluring, unofficial leader of this particular Neres office. With Neres, Maia faces danger and crazy situations daily; it\u2019s almost too much for her, but Maia is strong, and she does her best to hang on and make it through this unexpected turn her life has taken.", "episode": "24", "vintage": ["2004-01-15 to 2004-07-03", "2007-08-05 (Spain, Buzz Channel)"], "official_website": "http://www.jcstaff.co.jp/sho-sai/daph-shokai/daph-index.htm", "opening_theme": ["\"Asu no Blue Wing\" (\u660e\u65e5\u306eBlue wing) by Sae"], "ending_theme": ["\"Anata to Iu Toki\" (\u3042\u306a\u305f\u3068\u8a00\u3046\u6642\u9593) by CooRie (eps 1-16, 25)", "\"Anata to Iu Toki\" (\u3042\u306a\u305f\u3068\u8a00\u3046\u6642\u9593) by Mai Nakahara (eps 17-23, 26)", "\"Asu no Blue Wing\" (instrumental version) by Sae (ep 24)"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/crop900x350/video/category/471/key_art_daphne_in_the_brilliant_blue.jpg", "file_category": "d"}
