A new city, MegaTokyo, was then recreated due in no small part from the aid of a multi-million dollar company, Genom Corp. Genom created and mass-produced biomechanical creatures called Boomers to aid in the restoration of MegaTokyo. When the Boomers began to run out of control, the ADPolice at first tried to stop them, but they proved to be far more difficult to deal with than was first imagined. Under the ever looming Boomer threat, a group of four girls from varying degrees of society banded together. Calling themselves The Knight Sabers, they were the only ones with enough firepower and resourcefullness to defend the fledgling MegaTokyo from Genom and its berserk Boomers.", "episode": "8", "vintage": ["1987-02-25 to 1991-01-30"], "official_website": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140425222105/http://www.anime-int.com/works/bubblegum/crisis/", "opening_theme": ["\"Konya wa Hurricane\" (\u4eca\u591c\u306f\u30cf\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30f3; There's a Hurricane Tonight) by Kinuko Oomori (ep 1)", "\"Mad Machine\" by Kinuko Oomori (ep 2)", "\"CRISIS ~ Ikari o Komete Hashire~\" (\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30b7\u30b9 \u301c\u6012\u308a\u3092\u3053\u3081\u3066\u8d70\u308c\u301c; Crisis ~Run with Anger~) by Yuiko Tsubokura (ep 4)", "\"Mysterious Night\" by the Knight Sabers (ep 5)", "\"Say Yes!\" by Maiko Hashimoto (ep 7)", "\"Bye Bye My Crisis\" by the Knight Sabers (ep 8)"], "ending_theme": ["\"Mr. Dandy\" by Bluew (ep 1)", "\"Kizudarake no Wild\" (\u50b7\u3060\u3089\u3051\u306eWild; Wild and Scarred) by Kinuko Oomori (ep 2)", "\"Wasurenai de\" (\u5fd8\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3067; Don't Forget) by Kinuko Oomori (ep 3)", "\"Twilight\" by Yuiko Tsubokura (ep 4)", "\"Omoide ni Dakarete\" (\u601d\u3044\u51fa\u306b\u62b1\u304b\u308c\u3066; Embraced by Memories) by Yuiko Tsubokura (ep 5)", "\"Rock Me\" by Yuiko Tsubokura (ep 6)", "\"Never the End\" by Maiko Hashimoto (ep 7)", "\"Chase the Dream\" by Kinuko Oomori (ep 8)"], "insert_song": ["\"Akuma to Tenshi no Kiss\" (\u60aa\u9b54\u3068\u5929\u4f7f\u306e\u30ad\u30b9; Devil and Angel's Kiss) by Knight Sabers (ep 4)", "\"Asu e Touchdown\" (\u660e\u65e5\u3078\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30c0\u30a6\u30f3; Touchdown to Tomorrow) by Knight Sabers (ep 3)", "\"Kodoku no Angel\" (\u5b64\u72ec\u306e\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30eb; Lonely Angel) by Yuki Ueda (ep 1)", "\"Thrill ni Odoru Tenshi-tachi\" (\u30b9\u30ea\u30eb\u306b\u8e0a\u308b\u5929\u4f7f\u305f\u3061; Thrilling Angels) by Knight Sabers (ep 2)", "\"Victory\" by Kinuko Oomori (ep 3)"], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A201-1133355665.1429624509.jpg", "file_category": "b"}
