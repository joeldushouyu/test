He works with his little assistant Pinoko (who has a massive crush on the doctor), dealing with medical cases not very well known, which can be strange, dangerous, or not known at all. But he is a genius, and can save almost any of his patients' life (as long as they have the money for it, that is), and is known to many around the world, especially to those of medicine and science. He's a man of science himself, and does not believe much until he has seen it, yet it is many times he is surprised by love and nature often overpowering the science he bases his life in.", "episode": "61", "vintage": ["2004-10-11 to 2006-03-06", "2005-01-19 (Ep 1-4, Italy - Future Film Festival)", "2007 (ETC...TV - Chile \"Televix Dub\")", "2008-02-13 (Germany - Animax)", "2009-08-03 (Animax Latin America - Colombian Original Dubbing)", "2009-08-03 (Animax Latin America)", "2017-07-16 (ETC...TV - Chile \"Mexican Dub\")"], "official_website": "http://blackjack.jp/", "opening_theme": ["\"Gekkouka\" by Janne Da Arc (eps 1-28)", "\"Here I Am\" by globe", "\"Fantastic\" by Ami Suzuki"], "ending_theme": ["\"Kuroge Wagyuu Joshio Tanyaki 680 Yen\" by Ai Otsuka", "\"Kuroge Wagyuu Joushio Tanyaki Roppyaku Hachijuu En\" by Ai Ohtsuka (eps 1-28)", "\"clover\" by hiro", "\"careless breath\" by EXILE"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A4408-10.jpg", "file_category": "b"}
