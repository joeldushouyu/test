Enrolled at Cromartie High, where everybody is a delinquent, Kamiyama is apparently the only non-delinquent in the school. Logically, therefore, he must be the toughest in his class - by the rather twisted logic that only a really tough rabbit would lie down with lions. Thus begins a story that parodies every clich\u00e9 of tough-guy anime that you've ever heard of, and some you haven't. Oh, and Freddie Mercury is in it, too.", "episode": "26", "vintage": ["2003-10-02 to 2004-03-25", "2005-12-17 to 2006-01-28 (U.S. - \"Anime Unleashed\" (G4) [Eps. #1-13])"], "official_website": "http://discotekmedia.com/cromartie_high_school.htm", "opening_theme": ["\"Jun\" by Takuro Yoshida"], "ending_theme": ["\"Trust Me\" by Kunio Suma [Bikyoran]", "\"Cromartie High School School Song\" by Sun Plaza Nakano (eps 19,23)"], "insert_song": ["\"Ningen Nante\" (\u4eba\u9593\u306a\u3093\u3066) by Takuro Yoshida"], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A3102-40.jpg", "file_category": "c"}
