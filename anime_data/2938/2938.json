University entrance exams loom on the horizon, and it's spring break, and Y\u016bta and Rikka are together as usual. One day, Rikka's older sister T\u014dka declares that she's going to take Rikka to Italy with her, as T\u014dka is moving to Italy for work and she thinks they should move together as a family. Y\u016bta understands T\u014dka's opinion, but thinks that at this rate he and Rikka will be separated. Shinka and the other members suggest that Y\u016bta and Rikka should \"elope,\" and thus sets the stage for Y\u016bta and Rikka's travels throughout Japan in their escape drama.", "episode": 0, "vintage": ["2018-01-06"], "official_website": "http://www.anime-chu-2.com/", "opening_theme": ["\"JOURNEY\" by ZAQ"], "ending_theme": ["\"Kokoro no Namae\" by ZAQ"], "insert_song": ["\"Please, Take on me\u2661\" by ZAQ", "\"Sparkling Daydream\" by ZAQ"], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A19920-1193302026.1553782352.jpg", "file_category": "e"}
