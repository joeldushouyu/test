In opposition to this plan are the slightly nutty Kyuusaku Natsume and Nuku Nuku, the android who acts as a companion to his young son. Nuku Nuku's classmates are all eccentrics, Futaba, the class president, is a domineering control-freak, who cannot leave her authority in school. Chieko Shirakaba is the rich snob with the two yes-girls who always take her side. There is a bookworm, a mystic, a scientist, and a pop singer. All of these are true to their descriptions: the mystic is always foretelling doom via tarot cards, spirits, or some other occult technique. The pop singer never says anything except as a song. The bookworm always has her nose in a book. These eccentricities add to the series' humor.", "episode": "12", "vintage": ["1998-01-07 to 1998-03-25"], "official_website": "http://discotekmedia.com/Cat-Girl-Nuku-Nuku-Blu-ray.htm", "opening_theme": ["\"Fine Colorday\" by Megumi Hayashibara"], "ending_theme": ["\"Oyasuminasai Ashita wa Ohayou\" by Megumi Hayashibara"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A557-38.jpg", "file_category": "b"}
