In \"Alimony Hunter\" we see Jun in an extremely unusual three-for-all in which not everyone is what he (or she) seems. She also makes an appearance as a teacher in \"Cherry Lips\" (under an alias). It all comes to conclusion in \"Virgin Road\", there perhaps too-willing bride is having a last minute fling with her in the back room of the chapel; the groom is also not a stranger to Jun... Then there's a manly knight who discovers the joys of bondage at the hands of a fair maiden; and a samurai policewoman forced to tackle a giant walking statue, controlled by a sex-crazed megalomaniac, before it destroys Tokyo. \"Crimson\" is a bloody story of a man and his blind love slave.", "episode": "3", "vintage": ["1995-06-16 to 1995-11-22"], "official_website": "http://www.pinkpineapple.co.jp/yuuwaku/1/1.html", "opening_theme": ["\"In the Heat of the Night\" by Yukari Iwamura (ep 1)", "\"Tokimeki ni Wink\" (\u3068\u304d\u3081\u304d\u306b\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u30af) by Setsuna (ep 3)"], "ending_theme": ["\"Keep on Dreaming\" by Kaori Akima (ep 1)", "\"Girl Friend\" by Rie Iwatsubo (ep 2)", "\"Hana no Oedo no Harukaze Musume\" (\u82b1\u306e\u304a\u6c5f\u6238\u306e\u6625\u98a8\u5a18) by Satomi Koorogi (ep 3)"], "insert_song": ["\"Kaze ni matte\u2026\" (\u98a8\u306b\u821e\u3063\u3066\u2026) by Mika Kanai (ep 2)"], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A2578-23.jpg", "file_category": "c"}
