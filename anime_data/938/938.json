However the Brawlers soon learn some Bakugan were sent into an alternate dimension when Vestroia became six different groups. These Bakugan are now at war with each other as the Gunadlians and the Neathians fighting for control of their dimension and looking to recruit the strongest Earthlings to their cause.
