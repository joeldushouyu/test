Strangely, Kaito wakes up the next day perfectly fine, but with no recollection of what exactly happened the day before. Unfazed by what seems to have been just a dream, he heads to school not giving much thought to the incident. Discussing with his friends about the camera, they decide to make a movie during summer break. They invite two upperclass students to participate in the project: recently arrived Ichika Takatsuki and the odd Remon Yamano. In a strange twist of fate, Ichika starts living with Kaito as his sister has to work overseas. Summer days are about to get exciting for the small film crew.", "episode": "12", "vintage": ["2012-01-09 to 2012-03-26"], "official_website": "http://www.ichika-ichika.com/", "opening_theme": ["\"sign\" by Ray"], "ending_theme": ["\"Vidro Moy\u014d\" (\u30d3\u30fc\u30c9\u30ed\u6a21\u69d8) by Nagi Yanagi"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/crop900x350/video/category/800/key_art_waiting_in_the_summer.jpg", "file_category": "a"}
