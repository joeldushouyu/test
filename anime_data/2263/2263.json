They are cursed to compel their current owners to repeat the original murders. The curse also makes them indestructible. Kiri Haimura is the current owner of a pair of shears that can cut seemingly anything, although the only thing he wants to cut is hair. One day he meets Iwai Mushanokoji, a girl of whom he has only heard rumors that her hair cannot be cut, a girl who can grant one wish, any wish, but only to the person who murders her. Every morning he cuts her hair, which grows back every night; and every day he helps protect her from people who know about her curse and who want a wish granted.", "episode": "13", "vintage": ["2013-04-03"], "official_website": "http://crimeedge.com/", "opening_theme": ["\"Unmei no Ori\" (\u904b\u547d\u306e\u6abb) by Aimi"], "ending_theme": ["\"Kimi to Futari\" (\u541b\u3068\u4e8c\u4eba) by Karin Takahashi x Yurika Endo"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A14894-2505046468.1356621580.jpg", "file_category": "d"}
