But when Eia runs into Yuuga Ohta, she finds someone who believes in her abilities and introduces her to a world she never knew existed. Yuuga possesses an \u201cSCM,\u201d a device that allows people to take control of others entirely through participating in SCM duels. While Yuuga simply wants to use these duels to test his own potential, others are happy to use SCMs in order to trick people into becoming their willing slaves. Eia's powers of perception may shine in this new and menacing world, but she'll soon come to regret learning about the power of SCM.", "episode": 0, "vintage": ["2018-04-12"], "official_website": "http://doreiku-anime.com/", "opening_theme": ["\"Karakara na Kokoro\" (Dried-Up Heart) by Sh\u014dgo Sakamoto"], "ending_theme": ["\"BJ\" by Pile"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A20321-966597278.1517015289.jpg", "file_category": "d"}
