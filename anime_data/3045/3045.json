The only problem is that there's no Demon Lord in the world at the moment, which means nobody can choose Hero as their adventuring class. That leaves Yusha classless for the time being, but she's getting by with help from her friends Seira the priest, Fai the warrior, and Mei the mage. Their adorable new adventuring instructor Mao has challenged the class to complete a simple dungeon, but this pint-sized teacher might just be a little more demonic than she appears.", "episode": 0, "vintage": ["2019-01-12"], "official_website": "http://endro.jp/", "opening_theme": ["\"Endoro~ru!\" by Y\u016bsha Party"], "ending_theme": ["\"Wonder Caravan!\" by Inori Minase"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A21228-2404351300.1542774613.jpg", "file_category": "e"}
