She must stop the rogue A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) computer program known as Grosser and his hench-programs from taking over the world. Grosser was originally designed to be that manager of all of COMNET. At first she\u2019s very reluctant to play the heroine because of her complete lack of knowledge and ability with computers.
