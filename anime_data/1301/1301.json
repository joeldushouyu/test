There are two major groups involved in the ensuring war. The first group consists of monsters known as Chiropterans who can change their appearances into that of human beings. They are actually immortals who feed on the blood of the living. The second group is an organisation known as the \"Red Shield\", formed to track down these monsters and exterminate them. Otonashi Saya is a high-school girl who lives a peaceful life with her family. The only problem is, she has no recollections of her life beyond that of the past year. However, her happy life will be destroyed by an event that will lead her to her destined fate.", "episode": "50", "vintage": ["2005-10-08 to 2006-09-23", "2007-03-11 to 2008-03-23 (USA, Cartoon Network - Adult Swim)", "2007-04-12 (Animax Asia - Philippines)", "2007-04-17 (Spain - TVE)", "2007-04-29 (Animax Asia - Singapore and Thailand)", "2007-08-07 (Spain - Canal Buzz)", "2008-02-03 (Poland, AXN Sci-Fi)", "2008-03-24 (Russia, 2x2)", "2008-03-24 to 2008-05-26 (Russia,2x2)", "2008-11-03 to 2009-11-17 (Malaysia, Animax Mobile)", "2009-03-23 (Philippines, Studio 23)"], "official_website": "http://www.blood.tv", "opening_theme": ["\"\u9752\u7a7a\u306e\u30ca\u30df\u30c0 (Aozora no Namida)\" by Hitomi Takahashi (eps 1-13)", "\"SEASON\u2019S CALL\" by HYDE (eps 14-25)", "\"Colors of the Heart\" by UVERworld (eps 26-38)", "\"\u96f7\u97f3 (Raion)\" by Jinn (eps 39-50)"], "ending_theme": ["\"\u8a9e\u308a\u7d99\u3050\u3053\u3068 (Kataritsugu koto)\" by Chitose Hajime (eps 1-13,50)", "\"CRY NO MORE\" by Mika Nakashima (eps 14-25)", "\"This Love\" by Angela Aki (eps 26-38)", "\"Brand New Map\" by K (eps 39-49)"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A5088-11.jpg", "file_category": "b"}
