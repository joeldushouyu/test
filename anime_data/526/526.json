The three are Issa, an overly innocent, soft-spoken panda, Kenta, a highly strung, red-scarf-loving bear who puts on an almost constant tough-guy act, and Iyo, a rabbit who usually holds the importance of her own well-being and enjoyment over the happiness (and safety) of her \"friends.\" Even at only 5 years old, Ami-chan is easily the most rational of the group, and she's a little wary at first, but she eventually comes around and starts spending her free time with them. A typical day involves Ami-chan and the three doing different things to pass the time, often playing a seemingly innocent game, but in AniYoko style. Unfortunately for Ami-chan, the AniYoko version usually turns out to be drastically different, much less logical, and usually more dangerous than the ordinary version.", "episode": "51", "vintage": ["2005-10-04", "2008-09-01 (Philippines, Cartoon Network Philippines)"], "official_website": "http://www.mightymedia.com.tw/ANIYOKO/", "opening_theme": ["\"Tondemo Nothing ~Doki\u2606Doki Animal Yokocho no Uta no Maki~\" by Ami with Iyo, Kenta, Issa", "\"Love chu You!!\" by Ribbon Girl"], "ending_theme": ["\"Fantasista Girl\" by the Indigo", "\"Sweetie\" by Fumiko Orikasa"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A5793-160.jpg", "file_category": "a"}
