Together they attend Sakurahama Private High School, where several select girls obliviously use and abuse Junna for their own needs--Kishida Tomo, pretty and anti-social; the booksmart and efficient Iida Akino; Ohtori Tsubasa, head of the Help Club and highly in demand; Fujie Sana, cute as a button but with the intelligence of a box of rocks. And then there's the new girl, Inohara Haruhi--an old childhood friend of Junna's that's come to claim her \"onii-chan\" (brother). Strangely, Junna barely remembers Haruhi from his childhood...and Senna doesn't want him to.", "episode": "13", "vintage": ["2004-10-03 to 2004-12-26"], "official_website": "https://web.archive.org/web/20041120073338/http://www.trinet-ent.com/princess_hour/", "opening_theme": ["\"KIZUNA\" by Ayane"], "ending_theme": ["\"Omoide good night\" by tiaraway"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A4465-10.jpg", "file_category": "d"}
