The villains take over the forms of the feudal lords that rule the divided land, with the Joker taking the lead among the warring factions. As his traditional high-tech weaponry is exhausted almost immediately, Batman must rely on his intellect and his allies - including Catwoman and the extended Bat-family - to restore order to the land, and return to present-day Gotham City.", "episode": 0, "vintage": ["2018-04-24"], "official_website": "http://wwws.warnerbros.co.jp/batman-ninja/", "opening_theme": [], "ending_theme": [], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A20384-2142327326.1517132822.jpg", "file_category": "b"}
