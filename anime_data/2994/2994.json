While doing his teaching internship as part of his studies to become a qualified teacher, he ends up in a delinquent class and learns of the possibility and necessity of the power and respect gained from one's students. Due to a mishap, after graduating, he gets a job at a prestigious private school to handle their 'problem class' that made the past few teachers quit. He must now handle a different kind of trouble when the trouble-makers include some of the smartest kids in Japan who prefer a more \"intellectual approach\" to torturing their teacher. Onizuka must slowly win his students over and deal with their distrust and hatred towards teachers and adults while handling the distrust of his fellow teachers who feel him unworthy of being a teacher.", "episode": "43", "vintage": ["1999-06-30 to 2000-09-24", "2003-01-07 to 2004-03-16 (Italy)", "2003-11-03 to 2004-01-01 (USA)", "2004-08-30 to 2004-11-02 (France)", "2005-01-02 (Philippines, GMA-7)"], "official_website": "http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/Animation/GTO/", "opening_theme": ["\"Driver's High\" by L'Arc~en~Ciel (eps 01-16)", "\"Hitori No Yoru\" by Porno Graffiti (eps 17-43)"], "ending_theme": ["\"Last Piece\" by Kirari (eps 01-16)", "\"Shizuku\" by Miwaku Okuda (eps 17-33)", "\"Cherished Memories\" by Hong Kong Knife (eps 34-43)", "\"Driver's High\" by L'Arc~en~Ciel"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A153-153.jpg", "file_category": "e"}
