Unfortunately for her, instead of going through proper channels, Tsubasa lets her enthusiasm (and maybe her friend Tomoe's words) carry her away, and she charges onstage during the club presentation assembly to make her call for members. Although her homeroom teacher supports her efforts, and despite getting two potential members in the form of super-shy Ukita and slightly-leery Nozaki, the student council remains opposed to the team. That's not going to keep Tsubasa down, though \u2013 the girl's nothing if not enthusiastic and devoted to her dream.", "episode": 0, "vintage": ["2019-04-07"], "official_website": "https://anime-hachinai.com/", "opening_theme": ["\"Etude\" by Miyuhan"], "ending_theme": ["\"Donna toki mo\" (\u3069\u3093\u306a\u3068\u304d\u3082) by Nozomi Nishida, Reina Kondo, Saki Minami and Honoka Inoue"], "insert_song": [], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/fit200x200/encyc/A21671-2139486924.1549867437.jpg", "file_category": "c"}
