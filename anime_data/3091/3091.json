Every day he dreamed of being with the mercenary \"Light Finding Operation (LFO)\" aircraft pilot group \"Gekkostate\" and riding \"Trapar\" particle waves-- a sport called \"reffing\"-- with their charismatic leader Holland, especially when faced with his father's acclaimed past or his grandfather's desire to protect him. When a young girl named Eureka riding the original LFO, the \"Nirvash typeZERO\", asks his grandfather for a tune-up, she inadvertently brings the attention of the military to the garage; as a result, the garage is destroyed and Renton is forced to deliver a new type of interface-- the \"Amita Drive\"-- to the Nirvash. After a heated fight in which the Nirvash destroys the military LFOs by unleashing an immense amount of power, Renton is invited into Gekkostate. However, he quickly realizes that behind the facade of a traveling group of mercenaries is a very bitter reality.", "episode": "50", "vintage": ["2005-04-17 to 2006-04-02", "2006-04-16 (U.S. Broadcast - Adult Swim [CartoonNetwork])", "2006-09-08 to 2007-11-16 (YTV, Canada - Bionix)", "2007-06-05 (Germany - Animax)", "2010-04-08 (Italy, Rai 4)", "2010-07-14 (Philippines STUDIO 23)", "2011-04-08 to 2011-05-17 (3xl - Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya)"], "official_website": "http://www.eureka-prj.net/", "opening_theme": ["\"Days\" by FLOW (eps 1-13)", "\"Shounen Heart (Young Boy's Heart)\" by Home Made Kazoku (eps 14-26)", "\"Taiyo no Mannaka he (\u592a\u967d\u306e\u771f\u3093\u4e2d\u3078; To the Center of the Sun)\" by Bivattchee (eps 27-39)", "\"Sakura\" by NIRGILIS (eps 40-50)"], "ending_theme": ["\"Himitsu Kichi (Secret Base)\" by Kozue Takada (eps 1-13,26)", "\"Fly Away\" by Izawa Asami (eps 14-25)", "\"Tip Taps Tip\" by HALCALI (eps 27-39)", "\"Canvas\" by COOLON (eps 40-50)"], "insert_song": ["\"Get It By Your Hands\" by Hiroshi Watanabe (ep 28)", "\"L.F.O.\" by Taichi Master (ep 34)", "\"Rainbow (\u8679)\" by Denki Groove (ep 50)", "\"Storywriter\" by Supercar (eps 1,2,6,10,26,39)", "\"Time-Lines\" by audio active (ep 46)"], "image": "https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/crop900x350/video/category/104/11191.jpeg", "file_category": "e"}
